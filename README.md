# Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOC) Classification Project
## Introduction
- The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model to predict the approval status (either approved or denied) for Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOC) based on customer attributes in their applications. The model will be trained using the Huggingface HELOC dataset.

## Business Application and Impact
### This project aims to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of the HELOC application process. Specifically, it will:

- Improve Application Response Time: By automating the classification process, we can provide faster decisions on applications.
- Maximize 'Goods' and Minimize 'Bads': The model will aim to correctly identify credit-worthy applicants ('goods') and reject non-credit-worthy ones ('bads'), thereby improving overall revenue generation.

### Impacts:
- Optimized Business Processes: Automation of the classification process saves time and money, reduces employee workload, and allows staff to focus on more complex tasks.
- Reduced Human Bias: Historically, loan decisions were made at the discretion of Loan Officers, whose decisions were influenced by their experience and potential implicit biases. The model uses concrete data to make decisions, reducing the risk of misclassification due to human error or bias.
- Improved Decision Explanation: The model provides explainable results, enabling communication of reasons for denial to applicants. This transparency helps applicants understand and improve on the factors influencing their application outcomes, such as income, debt levels, credit scores, or credit history length.
